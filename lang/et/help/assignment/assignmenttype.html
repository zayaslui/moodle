<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Assignment Type</B></P>

<P>There are different types of assignments</P>

<P><B>Offline activity</B> - this is useful when the assignment is performed outside
of Moodle.  Students can see a description of the assignment, but can't upload files or anything.
Teachers can grade all students though, and students will see notifications of their grades.

<P><B>Upload a single file</B> - this type of assignment allows all students to upload a 
single file, of any type.  This might be a Word processor document, or an image, a 
zipped web site, or anything you ask them to submit.  Teachers can grade submitted 
assignments online.
