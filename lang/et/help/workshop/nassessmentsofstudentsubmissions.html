<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Number of Assessments of Student submissions</B></P>

<P>This number determines whether the students are asked to peer assess
	other students' work. If it is
	not zero then each student is offered that number of  pieces 
	of work from other students. After assessment the originator of the work
	can view the comments and possibly the grade given by their peer. 
	(The peer assessment process may be iterative depending on the setting of
	&quot;Agree Assessments&quot; option.) The teacher can also,
	if desired, grade these assessments and those grades can be used in the calculation of
	the final marks. The student is shown the teacher's comments  and grade 
	for each of their assessments if available.
