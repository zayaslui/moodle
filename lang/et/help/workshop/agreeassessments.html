<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Agreement of Assessments</B></P>

<P>A workshop assignment can have either of these characteristics:

<OL>
<LI>In the submission and assessment phase when the students see the 
	assessments made by other students there is no feedback 
	from the students who submitted the work to the students who made
	the assessment. There may be feedback from the teacher if the teacher
	choses to grade the student assessments and then the teacher's grades and 
	comments will be available to both the student whose work it is and 
	to the student who made the assessment. There will be, however, 
	be only one way feedback between peers on any one piece of work.
	
<LI>In the submission and assessment phase the students see the 
	assessments made by other students and they are allowed to comment 
	on these	assessments. They may agree or disagree with the (peer) assessment. 
	If they agree with the assessment then the assessment stands and is 
	used in the final calculations when determining the peer grade given to
	the particular piece of work. If, however, they do not agree with an 
	assessment the student who made the assessment is given an 
	opportunity to revise it. The revise/disagree loop can continue until
	either agreement is reached or the deadline is reached. An assessment
	which is still in &quot;dispute&quot; when the deadline is reached
	is not used in the final calculations. This gives two way feedback
	between peers on each piece of work.
</OL>
<P>If the second method of working is chosen there is the option of switching off the display
	of grades. That is, if this &quot;hide grades&quot; option is exercised, only the comments
	in the assessment are shown to the student who work is being assessed.
	The grades are shown only after agreement has been reached (on the 
	comments alone). Note that this option only effective when agreement on 
	assessments is required.
