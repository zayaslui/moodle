<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Peer Graded Assignment Type</B></P>

<P>A peer graded assignment can have one of two types:

<OL>
<LI>Only feedback on the assessment elements and the general comment 
	is entered. The grading of assessment elements is not seen in the 
	grading pages. Assignments themselves are not given an overall grade. 
	However, the grading performance of the students is measured and
	this, and only this measure contributes towards the final grades given
	to the students.
	
<LI>Here the teacher and peers are asked to provide both feedback and
	grades. The assignments are given an overall quantative grade as well
	as the qualative data. The final grade for a student will be calculated 
	from the (weighted) contributions of the teacher's grade, the mean 
	peers' grade and the student's grading performance.
	
</OL>
