<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Number of Assessments of Teacher's Examples</B></P>

<P>This number determines whether the students are asked to assess
	any example pieces of work before submitting their own work. If it is
	non-zero then each student must assess that number of example pieces 
	of work. They cannot submit their own work until these assessments
	have been made. The teacher can, if wished, grade these assessments
	and use those grades in the students' final grade. Any comments from
	the teacher	on these assessments are made available to the student but
	the teacher's &quot;grading grades&quot; are not shown to the student
	until after the deadline for submissions has passed.
