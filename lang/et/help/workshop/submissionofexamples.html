<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Submission of Teacher's Examples</B></P>

<P>If the students are required to assess some example pieces of work 
	before submitting their own work, the teacher uses this link to submit 
	that work. The teacher can submit any number of pieces of work. If the
	number of pieces of work is greater than the number of example 
	assessments each student must make, then the work is allocated in a
	random but balanced fashion. The system tries to assure that each of
	the examples is allocated to the students the same number of times.
	The allocation is random in that if, say, ten examples are submitted then
	it is highly unlikely that the first student is allocated submissions 
	1, 2 and 3 to assess.</P>

<P>If the teacher submits a fewer number of examples than given
	in the corresponding parameter of the assignment, the students
	are given just those examples to assess.</P>
	
<P>After the teacher has submitted the examples it is useful for the 
	teacher to assess these examples, if only partially. These assessments
	are private to the teacher, they are NOT show to the students at any 
	stage during the assignment. They are, however, shown to the teacher
	when the teacher looks at the student assessments of the examples.
	When grading the student assessment the teacher sees their own
	assessment at the top of the screen and the student's assessment
	of the same piece of work at the bottom. The &quot;extra&quot;
	assessment acts as a reference source and a reminder of the 
	salient points in the example.
