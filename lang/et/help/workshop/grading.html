<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Grading of Peer Assignments</B></P>

<P>For ease of grading a Peer Assignment is divided into a number of  
	assessment &quot;elements&quot;. Each element covers
	a particular aspect of the assignment. Depending on the type of assessment,
	for each element you should
<OL>
<LI>Enter a Grade by clicking in the appropriate button or selecting an appropriate
	number from the drop down menu.
	
<LI>Enter an explaination of why you gave that grade in the Feedback box. If
	you feel that the reason is obvious then leave the box empty. Note, however,
	that the teacher may look at your assessment and may well query a grade 
	if there is no explaination.
</OL>

<P>In other type of asessments, you are asked to determine if various items
	are present or absent, in others you are asked to choose which statement best 
	fits the peice of work. In both of these assignments you can adjust the grade
	somewhat as you see fit.

<P>The last box on this form allows you to make a general comment on the 
	work. This should justify your assessment. It should be polite and as far as
	possible constructive. Your assessment will be shown to the student who
	produced the piece of work.

<P>You have a limited period of time, typically half an hour, in which to
	change your mind and alter your grades or comments. Once that period
	is over the person whose work you are assessing is notified about the assessment.
	At that stage you can view your assessment but you cannot change it.
