<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Number of Comments, Elements, Bands or Criteria</B></P>

<P>The number entered here determines how many items will be used in
	the assessments. Depending on the type of grading strategy, this number
	gives the number of comments, assessments elements, bands or criteria  
	to be used in the assessments. Typically an assignment will have
	something between 5 to 15 assessment items, the 
	actual number depending on the size and complexity of the assignment. 
	
<P>All assessments have a General Comments field. For a &quot;No 
	Grading&quot; assignment the value given here determines the 
	number of additional comment areas. It can be specified as zero and results
	in the assessment having only a single General Comments area.
