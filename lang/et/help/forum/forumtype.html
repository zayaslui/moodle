<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Forum Types</B></P>

<P>There are several different types of forum to choose from:

<P><B>A single simple discussion</B> - is just a single topic, all on one page.
Useful for short, focussed discussions.

<P><B>Standard forum for general use</B> - is an open forum where any one can 
start a new topic at any time.  This is the best general-purpose forum.

<P><B>Each person posts one discussion</B> - Each person can post exactly one 
new discussion topic (everyone can reply to them though).  This is useful when 
you want each student to start a discussion about, say, their reflections on 
the week's topic, and everyone else responds to these.

<P>(More development to come in future versions of Moodle)
