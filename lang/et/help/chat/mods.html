<P>The Chat module allows participants to have a real-time synchronous 
   discussion via the web.  This is a useful way to get a different 
   understanding of each other and the topic being discussed - the mode
   of using a chat room is quite different from the asynchronous forums. 
   The Chat module contains a number of features for managing and 
   reviewing chat discussions.</P>
