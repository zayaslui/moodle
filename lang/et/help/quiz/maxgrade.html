<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Maximum grade</B></P>

<P>The maximum grade you set for a quiz is what all grades 
   are scaled to.

<P>For example, you might set the max grade to 20, because the
   quiz is worth 20% of the whole course.

<P>Even though you might have 10 questions in your quiz 
   worth a total of 50 marks, all grades out of 50 will be 
   "scaled down" to the quiz max grade of 20.
