<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Importing new questions</B></P>

<P>This function allows you to import questions from 
   external text files, uploaded through a form.  

<P>A number of file formats are supported:

<P><B>Missing Word</B></P>
<UL>
<P>This format only supports multiple choice questions.
Each answer is separated with a tilde (~), and the correct answer is 
prefixed with an equals sign (=).  Here is an example:

<BLOCKQUOTE>As soon as we begin to explore our body parts as infants
we become students of {=anatomy and physiology ~reflexology 
~science ~experiment}, and in a sense we remain students for life.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

</UL>


<P><B>AON</B></P>
<UL>
<P>This is the same as Missing Word Format, except that after importing 
   the questions all Short-Answer questions are converted four at a time
   into Matching Questions.</P>
<p>Additionally, the answers of multiple-choice questions are randomly 
   shuffled during the import.
<p>It's named after an organisation that sponsored the development of many 
   quiz features</p>
</UL>


<P><B>Blackboard</B></P>
<UL>
<P>This module can import questions saved in Blackboard's export 
format.  It relies on XML functions being compiled into your PHP.</P>

</UL>

<P><B>Custom</B></P>
<UL>
<P>If you have your own format that you need to import, you can 
   implement it yourself by editing mod/quiz/format/custom.php

<P>The amount of new code needed is quite small - just enough
   to parse a single question from given text.

<P>More formats are yet to come, including WebCT, IMS QTI and whatever else
   Moodle users can contribute! </p>
