<P>When reading texts quickly it is often very easy to misunderstand what the 
   author was trying to say.</P>

<P>To avoid misunderstanding, read their words carefully and try to see things
   from the author's point of view.<P>

<P>It can also help to think of what the author has NOT said or left in doubt
   - this may help you form questions in your own mind.</P>
