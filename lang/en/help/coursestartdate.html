<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Course Start Date</B></P>

<P>This is where you specify the starting time of the 
   course (in your own timezone).

<P>If you are using a 'weekly' course format, this will 
   affect the display of the weeks.  The first week will
   start on the date you set here.
 
<P>This setting will not affect courses using the 
   'social' or 'topics' formats.

<P>However, one place this setting will be affect is 
   the display of logs, which use this date as the earliest
   possible date you can display.
 
<P>In general, if your course does have a real starting date
   then it makes sense to set this date to that, no matter 
   what course formats you are using.
