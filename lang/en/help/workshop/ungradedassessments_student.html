<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>UnGraded Assessments (Student Submissions)</B></P>

<P><B>Assessment of Student Submissions</B> These are the peer assessments
	made by students on eachother's work. In general, these assessments do NOT
	have to be graded by the teacher. Provided each of the student submissions is
	assessed about five times, the system can make a reasonable judgement on 
	the inidivual assessment performance of the students. When the number of
	peer assessments is low then the teacher may want to grade these 
	assessments. Any grades given to the assessments can be taken into account
	when calculating the final grades for the students.
