<P>A Workshop is a peer assessment activity with a huge array of options.
   It allows participants to assess each other's projects, as well as 
   exemplar projects, in a number of ways.  It also coordinates the 
   collection and distribution of these assessments in a variety of ways.
   The Workshop module is contributed by Ray Kingdon.
