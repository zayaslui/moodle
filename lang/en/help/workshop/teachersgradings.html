<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Display of Teacher's Grades</B></P>

<P>A peer graded assignment can optionally make the teacher's comments 
	and grades available to the student's. If desired, these are shown after the
	submission deadline, or later if the grades are not available then. The teacher's
	comments and grades may well help the students when making their own
	(peer) assessments on other student's work.
	
<P>Note that even when the peer grading is done anonymously,  the 
	teacher's grades are always shown to the students with the teacher's 
	name and, if available, their photo.
