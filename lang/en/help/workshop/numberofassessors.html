<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Number of Peer Assessors</B></P>

<P>A peer graded assignment will normally have around 3 to 8 peer
	assessors. That is, in the peer grading phase, each student will be 
	asked to grade this number of pieces of work from the other students 
	in the class. The larger the assignment is, in terms of content, the 
	smaller this number should be, else the grading burden on the 
	students becomes onerous. However, each student should see sufficient
	examples to gain an insight into what constitutes a good piece of work 
	and a poor piece of work. Further for the grading performance of a
	student to be assessed meaningfully the greater the number of peer 
	gradings the better. This performance is unlikely to be valid if only three 
	or four gradings are done by each student.
	
<P>Provided there is enough pieces of work submitted (actually 10 or 
	more), the system will allocate each student at least one &quot;good&quot; and
	at least one &quot;poor&quot; piece of work. However, this can only be done if the
	teacher has graded the pieces of work BEORE the allocation of (peer) grading
	work is done. The teacher does NOT, however, have to grade all the 
	pieces of work, a sample is sufficient. Further, the teacher's gradings need 
	NOT be the final gradings, a preliminary grading is good enough. Note,
	however, that if the option to show teacher's gradings is turned on,
	these gradings will be shown to the students at the end of the submission
	phase.
	
<P>The number of peer assesors can be zero. In which case the assignment 
	becomes either a self-graded assignment if that option is turned on, or
	a normal teacher-graded assignment.
