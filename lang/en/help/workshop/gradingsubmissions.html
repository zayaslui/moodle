<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Grading of Student Submissions</B></P>

<P>In general the teacher will want to assess the work submitted by the
	students. The assessments are shown to the students and should provide
	feedback on their work.</P>
<P>The grades from these assessments can be used
	in two ways in the final grade calculation. Firstly, the grade itself can be 
	used as a (weighted) component in the final grade. Secondly, these 
	grades can optionally be added into the pool of peer assessments and 
	used as a &quot;calming factor&quot; if it felt that the student 
	assessments are too high or too low.
