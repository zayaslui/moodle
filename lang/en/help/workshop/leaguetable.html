<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>The League Table of Submissions</B></P>

<p>The League Table lists the best submissions produced in the assignment. The number 
	of entries can set to Zero, a number between 1 and 20, 50 or &quot;All&quot;. If set to 
	Zero then the League Table is <b>not</b> displayed. If it is set to a number between 
	1 and 20 or 50 then that number of submissions are shown, for example, setting 
	the number to 10 shows the top ten submissions. Setting the number to 
	&quot;All&quot; gives a table that lists all the submissions.</p>
	
<p>The second option contols whether the names of the students are included 
	in the Table or not. This option controls the students' view of the Table, the teacher 
	always sees the names of the students.</p>
