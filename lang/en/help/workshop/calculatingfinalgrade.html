<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>The Calculation of the Final Grade</B></P>

<P>The table on this screen shows how the the final grades for the students 
	are calculated. The final grades are a weighted sum of up to five components.
	
<OL>
<LI>The teacher's grade for their submitted work. This is optional and will be
	used if the teacher actually assesses the student's work. If the student submits 
	more than one peice of work the &quot;best&quot; grade is used. Here, best 
	means the piece of work with the highest weighted combination of teacher's
	grade and peer grade...
<LI>The average of the peer grades for their submitted work. Again if the student
	submits more than one peice of work the &quot;best&quot; grade is used. The
	peer grade can optionally
	include the teacher's grade. This grade would be included if the number of
	peer gradings is very low or it is thought that the peer gradings are suspect 
	either because of bias (usually on the high side) or for not being reliable.
	If included the teacher's grade is treated in the same way as a peer grade in 
	the calculation of the average.
<LI>The student's bias in grading peer work. This is measure of whether the
	student grades work either too high or too low. It is not an absolute measure
	as it is based on the difference between the student's grade and the peer
	averages for each of the submissions they assessed. In general this component
	should NOT be given a high weighting.
<LI>The student's reliability in grading peer work. This is a measure on how well
	a students grades follow the peer average for the peices of work they 
	assessed. The measure discounts the student bias and averages the absolute 
	differences between their grades and the peer average grades. In theory if
	the students gives high marks for good peices of work and low marks for poor 
	pieces of work their reliability will be high. If it is suspected that the students in
	general are poor assessors then the teacher's grades should be included into
	the ppeer averages, this should make the reliability values more meaningful.
<LI>The average grade given by the teacher for the student's assessments.
	This includes both the preliminary assessments made by the student on the 
	example pieces of work and any grading the teacher makes on the asessments
	produced during the peer assessement phase of the assignment. In general this
	component is probably more important than both the Bias and Reliability 
	components and thus, if available, should be weighted higher.
</OL>

<P>These five components can be weighted as deemed appropriate for the 
	assignment. For example the teacher's grade might be weighted strongly
	if the peer grading part of the assignment is only considered a minor part
	of the assignment as a whole. Alternatively, if the teacher only grades a few 
	of the submissions these grades can be ignored by giving them a zero weighting. 
	If the assignment is all about the students as judges and the providing of feedback
	then first two components may be set to zero (or low) and the students' 
	grading abilities will determine the final grades.

<P>Note that this screen is used iteratively and the final grades are not normally
	made available to the students until the final phase of the assignment. Once the
	the teacher is happy with the final grades and their weightings then they can 
	be made available to the students.
