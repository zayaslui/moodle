<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Self Assessment</B></P>

<P>A workshop assignment can optionally include the student's own work
	in the set of pieces each student is asked to assess. This will mean that if, say, the
	number of student pieces of work each student has to assess is set at 5, then 
	each student will be asked to assess 6 pieces of work, one of them being their own work.
	
<P>If the number of student pieces of work is set to zero and the self assessment option
	is turned on then the assignment becomes a self-graded assignment. This
	may or may not include the teacher's grading depending on the teacher's decision.
