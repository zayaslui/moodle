<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>The Final Grades</B></P>

<P>The table on this screen lists the final grades and their breakdown as shown to 
	the students. If there are missing values in the table then it is possible to &quot;go back&quot;
	and add these. In fact, there are two adjustments which can be made to the Final Grades.
	
<OL>
<LI>If a teacher's grade needs to be added then the piece of work can be 
	graded by going 
	to the teacher's Management screen for assignment and clicking on the link &quot;Student
	Submissions for Assessment&quot;. Any otherstanding submissions can be graded. Once this has 
	been done then move the assignment back to Phase 3 and re-calculate the Final grades. In a
	similar way any assessments which have not been graded can be graded from the Management 
	screen.
<LI>If it is desired to use a different weighting scheme then the assignment should be moved
	back to Phase 3 and link 	&quot;Calculate Final Grades&quot; can be clicked and the new 
	weights entered. After the grades have been re-calcualted the assignment should be moved 
	to Phase 4 to make the new grades available.
