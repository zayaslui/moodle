<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Assessment of Teacher's Examples</B></P>

<P>After the teacher has submitted the examples it is useful from the 
	teacher's point of view to assess these examples, if only partially. 
	These assessments are private to the teacher, they are NOT shown 
	to the students at any stage during the assignment. They are, 
	however, useful when the teacher looks at the student assessments
	of the examples. When grading a student assessment, the teacher 
	sees their own assessment at the top of the page and the 
	student's assessment of the same piece of work at the bottom of 
	the page. The &quot;extra&quot; assessment acts as a reference 
	source and a reminder of the salient points held in the example.
