<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Adding a Comment</B></P>

<P>Comments can be added to an assessment to:

<OL>
<LI>Add additional explaination or clarification to the assessment (by
	the student who assessed the piece of work);
<LI>Query the statements made in the assessment (by the student whose 
	piece of work is being assessed;
<LI>Try to resolve difficulties which may have arisen during the discussion
	on the assessment (by the teacher);
</OL>
<P>The aim of the comments is to try either reach agreement on the 
	current assessment or persuade the assessor to revise their assessment.
	This discussion should be undertaken in a reasonable way. 
	
<P>If the work is reassessed then the old comments are discarded and 
	are no longer shown with the new assessment.
