<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Include Teacher's Grade</B></P>

<p>This option allows the teacher's assessments of the submissions to be included
	as though they were peer assessments. If this option is set to YES then the teacher's 
	assessments are in effect counted twice, firstly as the normal teacher's 
	assessment and secondly by including them in the pool of peer assessments. 
	The teacher might want to do this if (a) the number of peer assessments of 
	each submission is low or (b) to try to stablise the peer assessments when 
	they appear to be either biased or unreliable.</p>
