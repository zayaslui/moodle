<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Anonymous Grading</B></P>

<P>A peer graded assignment can be graded anonymously. In this
	case the names (and any photos) of the students doing the grading 
	are not shown. Only the (file) names of the submissions are used to identify
	the peices of work being graded. 

<P>When the peer graded assignment is not graded anonymously, the 
	pieces of work are shown with the names (and any photos) of the 
	students who submitted the work. This may lead to bias in the gradings.

<P>Note that if the teacher's grades are shown to the students these are
	never shown anonymously.
