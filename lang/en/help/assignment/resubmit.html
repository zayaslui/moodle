<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Resubmitting assignments</B></P>

<P>By default, students cannot resubmit assignments once the teacher has graded them</P>

<P>If you turn this option on, then students will be allowed to resubmit assignments
   after they have been graded (for you to re-grade).  This may be useful if the 
   teacher wants to encourage students to do better work in an iterative process.</P>

<P>Obviously, this option is not relevant for offline assignments.</P>
