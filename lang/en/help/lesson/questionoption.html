<p align="center"><b>Question Option</b></p>

<p>A few of the Question Types have an option which is activated by clicking on
    the checkbox. The question types and the meaning of the options are 
    detailed below.

<ol>
<li><p><b>Multichoice</b> There is variant of Multichoice questions called 
    <b>&quot;Multichoice Multianswer&quot;</b> questions. If the Question 
    Option is selected then the student is required to select all the 
    correct answers from the set of answers. The question may or may not tell 
    the student <i>how many</i> correct answers there are. For example &quot;Which of the 
    following were US Presidents?&quot; does not, while "Select the two US 
    presidents from the following list." does. The actual number of correct 
    answers can be from <b>one</b> up to the number of choices. (A Multichoice 
    Multianswer question with one correct answer <b>is</b> different from a 
    Multichoice question as the former allows the student the possibility of 
    choosing more than one answer while the latter does not.)</p></li>

<li><p><b>Short Answer</b> By default the comparisons ignore the case of the 
    text. If the Question Option is selected then the comparisons are case 
    sensitive.</p></li>

<p>The other Question Types does not use the Question Option.</p>
