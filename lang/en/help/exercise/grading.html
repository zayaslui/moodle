<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Grading of Assignments</B></P>

<p>In this Exercise the same Assessment Form is used by Students and Teachers
	to assess the work produced. The form is used at different stages of the 
	exercise by the two groups, thus the explaination given here is divided into 
	two parts.</p>
	
<p><b>For Students</b></p>
	
<p>The assessment form is used mainly to show you how your work will be 
	assessed by the teacher. You are required to complete this form <b>before</b> 
	you can submit your work. You can use it as a checklist. The form is <b>not</b> 
	sent to the teacher when you save it. You can return to this form and amend it 
	(and your piece of work) as many times as you like provided you have 
	<b>not</b> submitted the work. Note that although you are allowed to, there 
	is no need to submit your work immediately after you have completely this form. 
	However, the contents of your assessment are frozen and made available to the 
	teacher when you submit your work.</p>
	
<p>If the teacher requests that you make changes to your work and to re-submit 
	it, you will <b>not</b> be asked to re-assess your &quot;new&quot; piece of 
	work. You only make this assessment &quot;first time round&quot;.</p>
	
<p>This (initial) assessment of your work is looked at by the teacher and they 
	can add comments and grade it. You will be able to see these comments and 
	the grade given to your assessment may form part of the final grade you 
	receive from this Exercise.</p>

<p><b>For the Teacher</b></p>

<p>The assessment form is used to grade the submissions of the students. 
	These grades normally form the major component of the students' final grade 
	for the exercise. The assessment, it's grade and any comments you make can 
	be viewed by the student who submitted the work. Once you have made the 
	assessment you should decide whether to allow the student to change and 
	re-submit their work, hopefully with improvements, or not.</p>
	
<p>When you save an assessment you given a short period of time in which to 
	make any amendments before the assessment to &quot;released&quot; to 
	the student.</p>
