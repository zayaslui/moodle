<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Grading of Assessments</B></P>

<p>In the first half of this page the Student Assessment of their own work is shown. 
	This assessment should be graded (out of a maximum of 20). It represents an 
	assessment of the work shown in the second of the Link boxes. (The topmost 
	link box is the description of the exercise itself.) The &quot;Grading Grade&quot; 
	should normally be explained in a comment which you enter in the Teacher's 
	Comment box. The grade should reflect the accuracy of the assessment, an 
	assessment which gives a low grade to a  poor piece of work should receive 
	a higher Grading Grade than one which gives a low mark to a good piece of 
	work, for example.</p>
	
<p>In the second half of this page there is a blank Assessment Form for your 
	own assessment of the piece of work from the student.</p>
