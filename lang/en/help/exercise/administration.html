<p>The first table on this screen shows how the the overall grades for the 
	submissions are calculated. The overall grades are a weighted sum of 
	two components.</p>
	
<ol><li>The teacher's grade for the student's (initial) assessment of their own work. 
	This can be  termed the &quot;grading grade&quot;. Once the student has 
	submitted their work the assessment is not revised. The student is NOT asked 
	to re-assess their work each time they resubmit their work. The grade given to 
	student's assessment is relavant to the student's performance but it is not as 
	important as the (teacher's) assessment of the work. In general it should be 
	given a lower weight than...
<li>The grade given by the teacher to the student pieces of work. These 
	assessments are the normally the main assessment element of an exercise
	assignment. When the students are allowed to make 
	more than one submission the teacher can decide whether the final grade 
	for the exercise should be the average grade of a student's submissions or 
	the grade from the student's best submission.
</ol>

<p>These two components are weighted as deemed appropriate for the 
	assignment. The teacher can, for example, weight the (initial) assessment grade
	(the grading grade) very low, even zero. In this case the student grade is 
	determined largely by or entirely by the grades given to their submissions. The
	two weighting factors can be changed at any time during the exercise, the effect
	of any change on the grades seen in the Grades page and in the Final Grades 
	list is immediate.</p>

<p>The second table is used to set the two options for the League Table. This table 
    is (optionally) shown to the students at the end of the assignment. If the 
    number of entries is set to a number larger than zero then the table is 
    displayed to the student when the assignment is in its final phase. The other 
    option determines whether student names are shown in the table. Note the League 
    Table as seen by the teacher always shows studnet names regardless of this setting.

<p>The Administration page also lists the teacher's submissions (the decriptions of
	the Exercise), the students' (initial) assessment of their own work, and the students'
	submissions. These tables allow all these items, where appropriate, to be re-titled, 
	deleted,  viewed or re-assessed. This part of the page can be used to monitor the
	students' progress throughout the course of the exercise.
