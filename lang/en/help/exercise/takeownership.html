<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Take Ownership of the Exercises</B></P>

<p>This link allows the teacher to take ownership of the current set of exercise 
	submissions.  You will need to do this if you have imported an exercise from a 
	backup of another course. This link allows you to &quot;claim&quot; 
	all the exercise submissions. In the current course these imported submissions
	could belong to anyone, even a student. This procedure avoids any problems 
	that this may cause and makes you their owner.
	
<p>Apart from onwership, the submissions themselves are unchanged by this 
	procedure.</p>
