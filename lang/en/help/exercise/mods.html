<P>An Exercise is a simple but powerful assignment. In an exercise the teacher 
asks the students to do a piece of practical work. It could be writing an essay 
or a report, preparing a presentation, or setting out a spreadsheet, etc. When 
the student has done the task they must first self-assess their work before 
submitting it to the teacher. Once submitted the teacher can assess both the 
student's assessment and the piece of work itself. The teacher can give 
feedback to the student  and ask the student to improve the work and re-submit 
it or not as the case may be.</p>
