<img valign=absmiddle src="<?php echo $cfg->wwwroot?>/mod/dialogue/icon.gif">&nbsp;<b>Dialogues</b></p>

<p>This module provides a simple communication method between pairs of users.
	A teacher can open an dialogue with a student, a student can open
	a dialogue with a teacher, and (optionally) a student can open a 
	dialogue with another student. A teacher or student can be involved 
	in many on-going dialogues at any time.</p>

<p>A dialogue can have an unlimited number of entries, normally the 
	&quot;conversation&quot; takes place as a set of interleaved
	replies. This format is not enforced and either party can add to the
	dialogue at any time.</p>

<p>A dialogue can be closed by either party at any time. Closed dialogues
	cannot be reopened. However, a closed
	dialogue can be viewed by either party provided it is still in existence... </p>
	
<p>...The module deletes closed dialogues and all their entries after a 
	certain time. That time is set here when the Dialogue is created.</p>
