<P>When writing text for others to read, try and write directly to your audience.</P>

<P>Explain your ideas as clearly and simply as you can to help avoid misunderstandings.
   One thing you can do is to avoid long words when a short one will do.</P>

<P>In a dialogue it will really help to keep your posts short and on-topic. 
    You can always close a dialogue and start another one if you want to start
    discussing something else.

<P>When replying to others, try and think of interesting questions you 
   can ask them.  This will help both you and the other person think (and learn!)
   about the subject you are discussing.</P>
