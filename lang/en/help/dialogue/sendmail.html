<p align="center"><b>Sending Mail Messages</b></p>

<p>If the box is ticked or checked then a mail message is sent to the 
    other person telling that you have added to (or started) a dialogue 
    with them. The message does <b>not</b> contain the entry, only a 
    short statement and, when appropriate, a link to where they can see
    the dialogue itself.</p>

<p>You only really need to send such mail messages if you think the other 
    person is unlikely to see your entry because of their infrequent 
    use of the course. The Participants list can tell you when they 
    were last active in the course.</p>
