<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Language Editing</B></P>

<P>To edit languages on this page the files need to be writable 
   by the web server process.

<P>Within some of the strings you will notice <B>$a</B> and <B>$a->something</B>.

<P>These represent variables that will be replaced by names or other words from 
   within Moodle.  

<P>When there is only one variable, the $a form is used.  When there are two or 
   more variables, then each one has a name.
