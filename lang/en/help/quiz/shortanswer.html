<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Short Answer questions</B></P>

<P>In response to a question (that may include a image) the respondent 
   types a word or short phrase.

<P>There may be several possible correct answers, each with a different 
   grade.  If the "Case sensitive" option is selected, then you can 
   have different scores for "Word" or "word".

<P>You can use the asterix character (*) as a <b>wildcard</b> to match 
   any series of characters.  For example, use ran*ing to match any word
   or phrase starting with "ran" and ending with "ing".  If you really 
   do want to match an asterisk then use a backslash like this: \*

<P>Without wildcards the answers are compared exactly, so be careful with your spelling!
