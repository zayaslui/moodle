<p align=center><b>Require network addresses</b></p>

<p>This field is optional.</p>

<p>You can restrict access for a quiz to particular subnets 
   on the LAN or Internet by specifying a comma-separated list of 
   partial or full IP address numbers.</p>

<p>This is especially useful for a proctored quiz, where you want 
   to be sure that only people in a certain room are able to 
   access the quiz.</p>

<p>For example:  <b>192.168. , 231.54.211.0/20, 231.3.56.211</b></p>

<p>There are three types of numbers you can use (you can not use 
   text based domain names like example.com):
<ol>
<li>Full IP addresses, such as <b>192.168.10.1</b> which will match 
    a single computer (or proxy).</li>
<li>Partial addresses, such as <b>192.168</b> which will match anything 
    starting with those numbers.</li>
<li>CIDR notation, such as <b>231.54.211.0/20</b> which allows you to specify
    more detailed subnets.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Spaces are ignored.</p>
