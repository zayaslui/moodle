<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Numerical questions</B></P>

<p>From the student perspective, a numerical question looks just
    like a short-answer question.</P>

<p>The difference is that numerical answers are allowed
    to have an accepted error. This allows a continuous range of answers
    to be set.</P>

<p>For example, if the answer is 30 with an accepted error of 5,
    then any number between 25 and 35 will be accepted as correct.</p>

<p>Numerical questions can also have case-insensitive non-numerical answers.
    This is useful whenever the answer for a numerical question 
    is something like N/A, +inf, -inf, NaN etc</p>
