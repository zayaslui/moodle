<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Question categories</B></P>

<P>Rather than keeping all your questions in one big list,
   you can create categories to keep them in.

<P>Each category consists of a name and a short description.

<P>Each category can also be "published", which means 
   that the category (and all questions in it) will be 
   available to all courses on this server, so that 
   other courses can use your questions in their quizzes.

<P>Categories can also be created or deleted at will.
   However, if you try to delete a category containing
   questions, then you will be asked to specify another
   category to move them to.
