<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>True/False questions</B></P>


<P>In response to a question (that may include a image) the respondent 
   chooses from True or False.

<P>If feedback is enabled, then the appropriate feedback message is 
   shown to the respondent after answering the quiz.  For example,
   if the correct answer is "False", but they answer "True" (getting 
   it wrong) then the "True" feedback is shown.
</P>
