<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Importing new questions</B></P>

<P>This function allows you to import questions from 
   external text files, uploaded through a form.  

<P>A number of file formats are supported:

<P><B>GIFT format</B></P>
<ul>
<p>GIFT is the most comprehensive import format available for importing 
   Moodle quiz questions from a text file.  It was designed to be an easy 
   method for teachers writing questions as a text file. It supports Multiple-Choice, 
   True-False, Short Answer, Matching and Numerical questions, as well as insertion 
   of a _____ for the "missing word" format.  Various question-types can be 
   mixed in a single text file, and the format also supports line comments, question names, 
   feedback and percentage-weight grades.  Below are some examples:</p>
<pre>
Who's buried in Grant's tomb?{~Grant ~Jefferson =no one}

Grant is {~buried =entombed ~living} in Grant's tomb.

Grant is buried in Grant's tomb.{FALSE}

Who's buried in Grant's tomb?{=no one =nobody}

When was Ulysses S. Grant born?{#1822}
</pre>

</ul>

<P><B>Aiken format</B></P>
<ul>
<p>The Aiken format is a very simple way of creating multiple choice questions using a very clear human-readable format. Here is an example of the format:</p>
<pre>

</ul>


<P><B>Missing Word</B></P>
<UL>
<P>This format only supports multiple choice questions.
Each answer is separated with a tilde (~), and the correct answer is 
prefixed with an equals sign (=).  Here is an example:

<BLOCKQUOTE>As soon as we begin to explore our body parts as infants
we become students of {=anatomy and physiology ~reflexology 
~science ~experiment}, and in a sense we remain students for life.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

</UL>


<P><B>AON</B></P>
<UL>
<P>This is the same as Missing Word Format, except that after importing 
   the questions all Short-Answer questions are converted four at a time
   into Matching Questions.</P>
<p>Additionally, the answers of multiple-choice questions are randomly 
   shuffled during the import.
<p>It's named after an organisation that sponsored the development of many 
   quiz features</p>
</UL>


<P><B>Blackboard</B></P>
<UL>
<P>This module can import questions saved in Blackboard's export 
format.  It relies on XML functions being compiled into your PHP.</P>

<P><B>WebCT</B></P>

<P><B>Course Test Manager</B></P>
<UL>
<P>This module can import questions saved in a Course Test Manager test bank.
It relies on different ways of accessing the test bank, which is in a Microsoft Access 
database, depending on whether Moodle is running on a Windows or Linux web server.</P>
<p>On Windows it lets you upload the access database just like any other data import file.</p>
<p>On Linux, you must set up a windows machine on the same network with the Course Test
Manager database and a piece of software called the ODBC Socket Server, which uses XML
to transfer data to moodle on the Linux server.</p>  <p>Please read the full help file below before
using this import class.</p>

<P><B>Embedded answers (Cloze)</B></P>
<UL>
<P>This special purpose format imports just one type of question, the 
Embedded Answers (also known as Cloze) format.
</p>

<P><B>Custom</B></P>
<UL>
<P>If you have your own format that you need to import, you can 
   implement it yourself by editing mod/quiz/format/custom.php

<P>The amount of new code needed is quite small - just enough
   to parse a single question from given text.

<P>More formats are yet to come, including WebCT, IMS QTI and whatever else
   Moodle users can contribute! </p>
