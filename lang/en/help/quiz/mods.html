<P>This module allows the teacher to design and set quiz tests, consisting of 
   multiple choice, true-false, and short answer questions.  These 
   questions are kept in a categorised database, and can be re-used
   within courses and even between courses.  Quizzes can allow 
   multiple attempts.  Each attempt is automatically marked, and the 
   teacher can choose whether to give feedback or to show correct answers.
   This module includes grading facilities.</P>
