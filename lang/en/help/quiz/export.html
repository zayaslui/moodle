<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Exporting questions from a Category</B></P>

<P>This function allows you to export a complete category of questions to 
   a text file.  

<p>Please note that in many file formats some information is lost
   when the questions are exported. This is because many formats do
   not possess all the features that exist in Moodle questions. You should 
   not expect to export and import questions and for them to be
   identical. Also some question types may not export at all.
   You are advised to check exported data before using
   it in a production environment.</p>

<P>The format(s) currently supported are:</p>

<P><B>GIFT format</B></P>
<ul>
<p>GIFT is the most comprehensive import/export format available for exporting 
   Moodle quiz questions to a text file.  It was designed to be an easy 
   method for teachers writing questions as a text file. It supports Multiple-Choice, 
   True-False, Short Answer, Matching and Numerical questions, as well as insertion 
   of a _____ for the "missing word" format.  Note that Cloze questions are not
   currently supported. Various question-types can be 
   mixed in a single text file, and the format also supports line comments, question names, 
   feedback and percentage-weight grades.  Below are some examples:</p>
<pre>
Who's buried in Grant's tomb?{~Grant ~Jefferson =no one}

Grant is {~buried =entombed ~living} in Grant's tomb.

Grant is buried in Grant's tomb.{FALSE}

Who's buried in Grant's tomb?{=no one =nobody}

When was Ulysses S. Grant born?{#1822}
