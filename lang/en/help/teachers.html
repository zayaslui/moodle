<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Teachers</B></P>

<P>This page shows the list of people who are assigned to be 
   "teachers" in this course (by the system administrator).

<P>You can use this form to assign a role (title) to each person 
   such as "Professor", "Tutor", "Assistant" and so on.  These 
   will appear on the site's course listing and also on the 
   list of participants for your course.   If you leave the 
   role empty then the default word for teacher will be used
   (the one you set in the Course Settings page).

<P>You can also order this list (to put the main teacher at the 
   top, for example).  Simply select numbers from the menus
   in the "Order" column. After pressing "Save changes" you will 
   see the new order.

<P><B>NOTE:</B> A special case occurs if you use select "Hide"
   for a teacher.  In this case, the teacher will 
   NOT BE SHOWN on the course listings or the list of 
   participants.  They will be "hidden" from students
   (unless they post messages to the forums etc)
