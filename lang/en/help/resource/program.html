<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Program Resources</B></P>

<p>A Program resource is an external resource that is able to accept data 
   passed to it from Moodle.</p>

<p>The data is passed via HTTP GET (as part of the URL) and includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>extern_nav: the URL from which the resource is being called
<li>extern_usr: the username of the current user
<li>extern_nam: the full name of the current user
<li>extern_tim: the current time
<li>extern_pwd: a unique password
</ul>

<p>All this is due to be revised sometime in the near future.</p>
