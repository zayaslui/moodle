<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Uploading a picture</B></P>

<P>You can upload a picture from your computer to this server, and this picture will be used in various places to represent you.
<P>For this reason, the best images to use are a close-up of your face, but you can use any image you like.
<P>The picture must be in JPG or PNG format (ie the names will usually end in .jpg or .png).
<P>You can get a picture file using one of four methods:

<OL>
<LI>Using a digital camera, your photos will most likely already be on your computer in the right format.
<LI>You can use a scanner to scan a printed photograph.  Make sure you save it as JPG or PNG format.
<LI>If you're artistic, you might draw a picture using a paint program.
<LI>Lastly, you can "steal" images from the web.  <A TARGET=google HREF="http://images.google.com/">http://images.google.com</A> is a superb place to search for images. Once you find one, you can "right-click" on them with the mouse and choose "Save this image..." from the menu (different computers may vary slightly).
</OL>

<P>To upload the image, click the "Browse" button on this editing page, and select the image from your hard disk.
<P>NOTE: Make sure that the file is not larger than the maximum size listed, or it will not be uploaded.
<P>Then click "Update my Profile" at the bottom - the image file will be cropped to a square and resized down to 100x100 pixels.
<P>When you are taken back to your profile page, the image might not appear to have changed.  If this is so, just use the "Reload" button in your browser.
