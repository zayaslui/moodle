<P>This setting specifies the way that each entry will be shown within the glossary.  The default formats are:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><b>Simple Dictionary</b>:</dt>
<dd>looks like a conventional dictionary with separate entries. No authors are displayed and attachments are shown as links.</dd>
<dt><b>Continuous</b>:</dt>
<dd>shows the entries one after other without any kind of separation but the editing icons.</dd>
<dt><b>Full with Author</b>:</dt>
<dd>A forum-like display format showing author's data. Attachments are shown as links.</dd>
<dt><b>Full without Author</b>:</dt>
<dd>A forum-like display format that does not show author's data. Attachments are shown as links.</dd>
<dt><b>Encyclopedia</b>:</dt>
<dd>Like 'Full with Author' but attached images are shown inline.</dd>
<dt><b>FAQ</b>:</dt>
<dd>Useful for displaying lists of Frequently Asked Questions.  It automatically appends the words QUESTION and ANSWER in the concept and definition respectively.</dd>

<p>Moodle Administrators can create new formats as follows:
<ol>
<li> Look in mod/glossary/formats ... you should see a numbered file for every existing format.
<li> Copy one of these and call it another number N (note that 0 and 1 are reserved).
<li> Edit this file accordingly to create your own format (some PHP knowledge required).
<li> Finally, insert a new entry in every language pack you use called <b>displayformatN</b>, and give it a short but meaningful name.
</ol>
