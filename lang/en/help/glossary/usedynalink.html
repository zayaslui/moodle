<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Automatically link glossary entries</B></P>

<P>Turning this feature on will allow the entries in this glossary to be automatically linked whenever 
   the concept words and phrases appear throughout the rest of the same course.  This includes forum
   postings, internal resources, week summaries, journals and so on.  </p>

<p>If you do not want particular text to be linked (in a forum posting, say) then you should add &lt;nolink> and &lt;/nolink> tags around the text.</p>

<p>Note that category names are also linked.</p>
