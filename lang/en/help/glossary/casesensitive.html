<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Case sensitive matching</B></P>

<P>This setting specifies whether matching exact upper and lower case is 
   necessary when performing automatic linking to these entries.</p>

<p>For example, if this is turned on, then a word like "html" in a forum
   posting will NOT be linked to a glossary entry called "HTML".</p>
