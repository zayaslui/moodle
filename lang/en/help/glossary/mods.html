<P>This activity allows participants to create and maintain a list of definitions, like a dictionary.
<P>The entries can be searched or browsed in many different formats.
<P>The glossary also allows teachers to export entries from one glossary to another (the main one) within the same course.
<P>Finally, it is possible to automatically create links to these entries from throughout the course.</p>
