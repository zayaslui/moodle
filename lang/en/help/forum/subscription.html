<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Forum Subscription</B></P>

<P>When a person is subscribed to a forum it means that 
they will be sent email copies of every post in that forum
(posts are sent about <?PHP echo $CFG->maxeditingtime/60 ?> minutes 
after the post was first written).

<P>People can usually choose whether or not they want to be 
subscribed to each forum.

<P>However, if a teacher forces subscription on a particular forum 
then this choice is taken away and everyone in the class will get 
email copies.

<P>This is especially useful in the News forum and in forums
towards the beginning of the course (before everyone has 
worked out that they can subscribe to these emails themselves).
