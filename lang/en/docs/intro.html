<h1>Introduction</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>Moodle is a software package for producing internet-based courses and web sites. 
  It's an ongoing development project designed to support a <a href="?file=philosophy.html">social constructionist</a> framework of education. </p>
  <p>Moodle is provided freely as <a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition_plain.html" target="_top"> 
  Open Source</a> software (under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html" target="_top"> 
  GNU Public License</a>). Basically this means Moodle is copyrighted, but that 
  you have additional freedoms. You are allowed to copy, use and modify Moodle 
  provided that you agree to: <strong>provide the source to others</strong>; <strong>not 
  modify or remove the original license and copyrights</strong>, and <strong>apply 
  this same license to any derivative work</strong>. Read the license for full 
  details and please contact the <a href="http://moodle.org/user/view.php?id=1&course=1">copyright 
  holder</a> directly if you have any questions. 
</p>
  <p>Moodle will run on any computer that can run <a href="http://www.php.net/" target="_top"> 
  PHP</a>, and can support many types of database (particularly <a href="http://www.mysql.com/" target="_top">MySQL</a>).</p>
  <p>The word Moodle was originally an acronym for Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic 
  Learning Environment, which is mostly useful to programmers and education theorists.&nbsp; 
  It's also a verb that describes the process of lazily meandering through something, 
  doing things as it occurs to you to do them, an enjoyable tinkering that often 
  leads to insight and creativity. As such it applies both to the way Moodle was 
  developed, and to the way a student or teacher might approach studying or teaching 
  an online course. Anyone who uses Moodle is a Moodler.</p>
