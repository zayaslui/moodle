  <p>Moodle is an active and evolving work in progress. Development was started 
  by <a href="http://moodle.org/user/view.php?id=1&course=1" target="_top">Martin 
  Dougiamas</a> who continues to lead the project:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>I've been working on it, in some way or other, for several years. It 
    started in the 90's when I was webmaster at <a target=_top href="http://www.curtin.edu.au/">Curtin 
    University of Technology</a> and a system administrator of their WebCT installation. 
    I encountered many frustrations with the WebCT beast and developed an itch 
    that needed scratching - there had to be a better way (no, not Blackboard 
    :-)</em></p>
    <p><em>I also know a lot of people in schools and smaller institutions (and 
    some big ones!) who want to make better use of the Internet but don't know 
    where to start in the maze of technologies and pedagogies that are out there. 
    I've always hoped there would be a Free alternative that such people could 
    use to help them move their teaching skills into the online environment. </em></p>
    <p><em>My strong beliefs in the unrealised possibilities of Internet-based education 
    led me to complete a Masters and then a PhD in Education, combining my former 
    career in Computer Science with newly constructed knowledge about the nature 
    of learning and collaboration. In particular, I am particularly influenced 
    by the epistemology of social constructionism - which not only treats learning 
    as a social activity, but focusses attention on the learning that occurs while 
    actively constructing artifacts (such as texts) for others to see or use. 
    </em></p>
    <p><em>It is crucial to me that this software be easy to use - in fact it should 
    be as intuitive as possible. </em></p>
    <p><em>I'm committed to continuing my work on Moodle and on keeping it Open 
    and Free. I have a deeply-held belief in the importance of unrestricted education 
    and empowered teaching, and Moodle is the main way I can contribute to the 
    realisation of these ideals.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>A number of early prototypes were produced and discarded before he released 
  version 1.0 upon a largely unsuspecting world on August 20, 2002. This version 
  was targeted towards smaller, more intimate classes at University level, and 
  was the subject of research case studies that closely analysed the nature of 
  collaboration and reflection that occurred among these small groups of adult 
  participants.
</p>
  <p>Since then there has been steady series of new releases adding new features, 
  better scalability and improved performance. 
</p>
  <p>As Moodle has spread and the community has grown, more input is being drawn 
  from a wider variety of people in different teaching situations. For example, 
  Moodle is now used not only in Universities, but in high schools, primary schools, 
  non-profit organisations, private companies, by independent teachers and even 
  homeschooling parents. A growing number of people from around the world are 
  contributing to Moodle in different ways - for more details see the <a href="?file=credits.html">Credits</a> 
  page. 
</p>
  <p>An important feature of the Moodle project is the <a href="http://moodle.org" target="_top">moodle.org</a> 
  web site, which provides a central point for information, discussion and collaboration 
  among Moodle users, who include system administrators, teachers, researchers, 
  instructional designers and of course, developers. Like Moodle, this site is 
  always evolving to suit the needs of the community, and like Moodle it will 
  always be Free.
</p>
  <p>In 2003, the company <a href="http://moodle.com/" target="_top">moodle.com</a> 
  was launched to provide additional commercial support for those who need it, as 
  well as managed hosting, consulting and other services.
