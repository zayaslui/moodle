Portuguese (from Portugal) Translation

If you'd like to contribute any corrections or aditions, please
send them do villate@fe.up.pt or, even better, join the Moodle-pt "course"
(http://edulivre.fe.up.pt/moodlept/) for the contributors to the translation.

You can make some local changes to the translation to suit your needs.
For instance, if you think your site will look better if you translate "Course
Categories" as "Licenciaturas", instead of "Grupo de Disciplinas", as used in
the Portuguese language pack, you can make a copy of the whole directory pt
(under "lang" in the directory where you have installed Moodle) with a
different name, for instance, pt_LX (maximum 5 characters). You will then see
another language "pt_LX" among the choices, which you can choose as the
preferred language for your site. The only problem is that we will have
to manually insert any changes and updates introduced in the pt language
pack.
