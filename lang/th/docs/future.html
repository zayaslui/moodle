<h1>Future</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>As Moodle gains in maturity, its directions are increasingly influenced by 
  the community of developers and users. A dynamic database of proposed features 
  and their status can be found at <a target=_top href="http://moodle.org/bugs/">moodle.org/bugs</a>. 
  Your <a href="?file=credits.html">contributions</a> in the form of ideas, code, 
  feedback and promotion are all very welcome - see the <a href="?file=developer.html">Developers 
  manual</a> for more details.</p>
  <p>Here is our current vision of the future, though this always changes depending on what developers want to work on.
</p>
  <h3>Version 1.3 - May 2004</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Coming only weeks after Moodle 1.2, the main purpose of this release is to add the recently developed support for calendars and events into the main distribution.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h3>Version 2.0  - Later in 2004</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This major release will include some major changes in internal structure
    designed to add flexibility and scalability in many areas.  Among the major 
    targets are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Completely rewritten display layer using XHTML-compatible code and complete implementation 
           of templates for increased standards-compliance, flexibility and accessibility </li>
      <li> Wider use of PHP classes in key areas of the Moodle code, to make some 
           things easier for programmers writing new modules or integrating with 
           external systems</li>
      <li>New architecture for Enrolments with plugins (similar to the 
        existing Authentication architecture) so that
        external systems (eg Student Records, Paypal, LDAP etc) 
        can control student and teacher access within courses</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>Version 2.1</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This  release will start to take advantage of the new structuring and add new features such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>New access-control system allowing finely-defined roles and rights
</li>
      <li> Stronger pedagogical support for both teachers and students </li>
      <li>Basic support for  standard learning objects (SCORM content packages)</li>
      <li>Better integration of Moodle with moodle.org (for teachers to share and collaborate)</li>
    </ul>
