<h2>Future</h2>

<p>As Moodle gains in maturity, its directions are increasingly influenced by 
  the community of developers and users. A dynamic database of proposed features 
  and their status can be found at <a target=_top href="http://moodle.org/bugs/">moodle.org/bugs</a>. 
  Your <a href="?file=credits.html">contributions</a> in the form of ideas, code, 
  feedback and promotion are all very welcome - see the <a href="?file=developer.html">Developers 
  manual</a> for more details.</p>

<p>Here is a rough map of the future (subject to change): 
<dl>

  <dt>Version 1.2 - Late 2003</dt>
  <dd>The major targets for this version include:
    <ul>
    <li>Support for groups/cohorts within courses</li>
    <li>New architecture for Enrolments with plugins (similar to the 
        existing Authentication architecture) so that
        external systems (eg Student Records, Paypal, LDAP etc) 
        can control student access within courses</li>
    <li>Miscellaneous contributed code and bug fixes</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

<dt>Version 2.0  - Early 2004</dt>
<dd>This major release will include some major changes in internal structure
    designed to add flexibility and scalability in many areas.  Among the major 
    targets are:
    <ul>
      <li> Rewritten display layer using XHTML-compatible code and complete implementation 
           of templates for increased standards-compliance, flexibility and accessibility </li>
      <li> Wider use of PHP classes in key areas of the Moodle code, to make some 
           things easier for programmers writing new modules or integrating with 
           external systems</li>
      <li> Stronger pedagogical support for both teachers and students </li>
      <li> New access-control system allowing finely-defined roles and rights</li>
      <li> Basic support for IMS and SCORM </li>
      <li> Better integration of Moodle with moodle.org</li>
      <li> Whatever else comes along :-) </li>
    </ul>
</dd>
