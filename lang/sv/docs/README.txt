Moodle documentation
--------------------

If you want to translate this documentation into another language,
I would suggest that you:

 1) don't include English versions of the files in this directory
    because they will be used automatically anyway if it is missing
    from your language pack.

 2) translate them in this order (starting with the important ones):
  
    MOST IMPORTANT
    |-------------------
    |
    |   - files.php
    |   - install.html
    |   - installamp.html
    |   - upgrade.html
    |   - faq.html
    |
    |  -----------------
    |
    |   - teacher.html
    |   - module_files.txt
    | 
    |  -----------------
    |   
    |   - intro.html
    |   - features.html
    |   - release.html
    |
    |  -----------------
    |
    |   - developer.html
    |   - cvs.html
    |   - future.html
    |
    |  -----------------
    |   
    |   - license.html
    |
    |-------------------
    LEAST IMPORTANT

 3) Please don't translate credits.html at all - it changes too much.
