<p align="center"><b>Att hantera en &Ouml;vningsuppgift</b></p>

<p>
En &Ouml;vningsuppgift &auml;r n&aring;got mer komplex &auml;n en vanlig uppgift.
Det ing&aring;r fyra steg eller faser i den. 
<br />
Dessa &auml;r:
<ol>
<li><b>Skapa &Ouml;vningsuppgiften</b> 
	<br />
	Bed&ouml;mningen/v&auml;rderingen/betygss&auml;ttningen av en &Ouml;vningsuppgift underl&auml;ttas
	om Du delar upp den i ett antal komponenter som ska bed&ouml;mas/v&auml;rderas/betygss&auml;ttas.
	Det g&ouml;r betygss&auml;ttningen mindre godtycklig och ger studenterna/eleverna/deltagarna/de l&auml;rande 
	en modell f&ouml;r sitt arbete med bed&ouml;mning/v&auml;rdering/betygss&auml;ttning.
	Det &auml;r Du som distansl&auml;rare som har rollen att skapa dessa komponenter och p&aring; s&aring; s&auml;tt
	tillhandah&aring;lla en mall f&ouml;r att s&auml;tta betyg/avge omd&ouml;men.

	<br /><br />
	With the assessment elements set up the teacher must submit a 
	Word Document or HTML file which describes the exercise or task to be done
	by the students. This file is shown to the students in the second phase of
	the exercise. 
	<br /><br />
	Teachers can, if they wish, prepare a set of similar exercies, again as
	Word Documents or HTML files, and upload those into the Exercise. Note that
	these exercises must be quite similar as the same Assessment Form is used
	for all of these variants. The submission of a multiple set of exercises by 
	the teacher is optional and for certain assignments may not be appropriate.
	<br /><br /></li>
<li><b>Allow Students Assessments and Submissions</b> 
<br />
The assignment 
	is now opened to the students. If the teacher has set up multiple exercises then 
	the students see different exercises, otherwise all the students see the same 
	exercise.
	<br /><br />
	Before the students can submit their work they must complete the assessment 
	form. Once they have completed the assessment they are shown the upload form. 
	The students can revise their work in the light of their self assessment. The teacher 
	sees student's (self) assessment and an assessment form to grade the student's 
	submission. This is a &quot;dual assessment form&quot;. At the end of this 
	form the teacher can either ask the student to re-submit the work or not.
	<br /><br />
	If the student chooses to re-submit, the teacher can re-assess the work. The 
	same option, re-submit or not, allows the teacher to control this cycle of 
	re-submission and assessment. If students are allowed to put in multiple pieces
	of work into the Exercise, the teacher should decide whether the final grades 
	are based on the student's maximum grade or their average grade over the 
	set of submissions. This option can be changed at any time during the Exercise
	by updating the Exercise, it's effect is seen immediately in the Grade page.
	<br /><br />
</li>
	
<li><b>Stop Student Assessments and Submissions</b> After the deadline 
	has passed, the teacher moves the Exercise to this phase to stop further 
	assessments and submissions. The teacher should complete the grading 
	any outstanding assessments and submissions before moving the Exercise
	to its final phase.
	<br /><br />
	</li>

<li><b>Show Overall Grades and League Table</b> In this final phase of 
	the Exercise the students can see their &quot;final&quot; grades. In all 
	phases of the Exercise (except the first phase), grades are available to
	the students, they are, however, only &quot;partial&quot; grades as they are
	calculated on the fly from the assessments available at the time.
	<br /><br />
	The students (and the teacher) are also shown a &quot;League Table&quot;
	of the student submissions. These are listed in order of grade, the top submission
	is first. Here the grade given to the submission is teacher's
	grade. If a student submitted more than one piece of work only their best piece 
	of work is shown in this table. </li>
</ol>

<p>The student's grade is a weighted combination of the teacher's grading of their
	(initial) assessment and the teacher's grading of their work. The two weighting 
	factors are initally set to unity. They can changed (on the Administration page)
	at any time during the exercise and the grades shown both the students and the
	teacher always reflect the current weighting factors.</p>
	
<p>At any phase of the assignment the teacher can open the &quot;Administration&quot;
	page. This shows the current values of the two weighting factors and allows the teacher
	to change them. It lists the students' assessments (of  their own work) and the 
	submissions of the students. The teacher can use this page to assess and re-assess 
	submissions, grade and re-grade assessments, delete submissions and assessments, 
	and generally watch the progress of the assignment.</p>
