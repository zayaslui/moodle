	Upgrading ADOdb to 4.11 ... there were lots of little bug fixes

2004-01-29 Thursday 18:25  moodler

	* lib/datalib.php: 
	
	Fixed problem with magic quotes

2004-01-29 Thursday 17:57  moodler

	* mod/journal/lib.php: 
	
	Don't always use arraymerge in journal_get_users_done() - was
	causing bad data sometimes ...

2004-01-29 Thursday 07:27  moodler

	* lib/datalib.php: 
	
	IMPORTANT!  CRUCIAL CHANGE TO MAJOR FUNCTION!
	
	Petri Asikainen rewrote insert_record to use ADOdb functions.  It
	might be very slightly slower but it gets rid of all the horrible
	not-quite-working PostgreSQL workarounds the old one contained.
	
	It worked for him on PostgreSQL 7.4 and for me on MySQL 3.23 and
	4.0.15, so I'm checking it in.
	
	Please test it thoroughly on your test systems.
	
	Since it writes data it has the potential to stuff things up, so be
	careful on production systems for a few days.

	mod/quiz/db/postgres7.php: 
	
	Added some bug-fixing code from Eloy Lafuente that fixes a quiz
	problem.
	
	What happens is that adding random questions used to set the
	timestamps of these questions to the same value.  This is fine in
	normal operation, but it stuffs up the backup of that course,
	overwriting the question.  When the course is restored, the missing
	questions cause quizzes to have lots of red notices like "Question
	not found".
	
	Anyhow, this patch should safely fix older installations that may
	have these duplicate questions lying around.
	
	THANKS ELOY!

	* mod/journal/lib.php: 
	
	This is a massive speed increase in journal_get_users_done.
	
	The fix requires UNION support in the database.  I've added a
	simple little test to see if UNION queries work.
	
	This change very much needs to be tested out by someone using MySQL
	3.  If it tests out there successfully, the supports_union code
	should be moved out of this file and into datalib.  Ideally,
	someone will extend that test and creatle get_records_union_sql, a
	function that would split up UNION queries for databases that don't
	support them and do an array_merge (and proper sorting, which is
	missing from my fix) on the result sets.

	These changes implement some better controls for controlling
	uploads.
	
	1) There is a new site-wide configuration variable called maxbytes,
	   which provides an upper filesize limit for all (student)
	uploads.
	
	2) There is a new course-level variable called maxbytes, which
	further    limits uploads within a course.
	
	3) There is a new maxbytes field for forums, which further
	restricts    the size allowed in a particular forum.  There is also
	a new config	variable in the module configuration to specify a
	default size	to use when defining a new forum.
	
	4) Assignments already had a limit, but this is now aware of the
	other	 limits, and like forums there is now a settable default
	value.
	
	5) Finally, the sizes of files (Gb, Mb, Kb, bytes) is now
	translatable	in the language packs.

	Some docs for PostgreSQL sockets users (see bug #749)

2003-09-14 Sunday 10:39  moodler

	* lib/datalib.php: 
	
	When adding a new column, set all the default values manually

2003-09-14 Sunday 10:20  moodler

	* course/lib.php: 
	
	Reduced size of table cells ... might need to work on editing
	buttons

2003-09-14 Sunday 09:43  moodler

	* course/lib.php: 
	
	Some tidying up of the editing icons

	Strings to move activities left and right

2003-09-14 Sunday 09:31  moodler

	* version.php, backup/backuplib.php, backup/restorelib.php,
	course/lib.php, course/mod.php, lib/db/mysql.php, lib/db/mysql.sql,
	lib/db/postgres7.php, lib/db/postgres7.sql: 
	
	New field on course_modules called "indent" ... this is an integer
	that tells us how far to indent the activity when it is displayed.
	
	This gives us some more flexibility on the course outline to
	arrange things as we might like them, into subtopics etc
	
	Backup/restore is updated as well.
	
	There is also a bit more robustness in course/mod.php

	* mod/label/: backuplib.php, lib.php, restorelib.php: 
	
	Added "graphical structure".  Added label_get_participants()
	function.

2003-09-14 Sunday 08:20  moodler

	* mod/label/: backuplib.php, restorelib.php:

2003-09-14 Sunday 08:20  moodler

	* mod/label/: version.php, db/mysql.php, db/mysql.sql,
	db/postgres7.php, db/postgres7.sql: 
	
	Added a course field (whoops!) and edited backuplib.php and
	restorelib.php

	view.php, db/mysql.php, db/mysql.sql, db/postgres7.php,

	New module:  Label.

	* lib/setup.php, lib/weblib.php, course/lib.php, course/mod.php,

	course/format/weeks.php: 
	
	Two things are in this checkin:
	
	1) Support for the new "label" module has been added.  It's
	unfortunate    about having to make these exceptions but this was
	the overall cleanest	way I could think of.
	
	2) All local calculation of pixpath and modpixpath has been removed
	and    replaced with a single calculation which is done in
	setup.php and	 stored in $CFG->pixpath and #CFG->modpixpath.	All
	graphics should    use these variables so that themes can easily
	override them.
