To Do
=====

Use a better method to measure bias in peer grades, probably based on the
	percentage difference rather the relative difference used at present.

Add time-agreed test to calculation of final grades.

Comments are seen by a third party, is this standard Moodle behaviour?

Cron function should email something to the assessor when an assessment is
	agreed.
	
Add a league table of submissions in the final phase for students.

	view - Done
