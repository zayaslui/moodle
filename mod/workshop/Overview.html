<h3>Overview</h3>
This new module enables the teacher to set up a controlled assignment
which encourages students to become more critical of both their own work
and that of others. In its standard form, the module usually begins with
a preparatory phase where the teacher sets up the assessment criteria.
These will depend on which assessment strategy the teacher decides to
use for the assignment. There are four separate strategies:<br>
<ol>
  <li><b>No grading:</b> In this type of assignment the teacher is not
	interested in quantative assessment from the students at all. The
students 	make comments of the pieces of works but not not grade them.
The teacher, 	however, can, if desired, grade the student comments.
These 	"grading grades" form the basis of the students' final grades.
	If the teacher does not grade the student assessments then the
assignment 	does not have any final grades. 	 </li>
  <li><b>Accumulative grading:</b> This is the default type of grading.
	In this type of assignment the grade of each 	assessment is made up of
a number of "assessment elements". 	 Each element should cover 	a
particular aspect of the assignment. Typically an assignment will have
	something between 5 to 15 elements for comments and grading, the
	actual number depending on the size and complexity of the assignment. A
peer 	assignment with only one element is allowed and has a similar
assessment 	strategy to the standard Moodle Assignment.</li>
  <li><b>Error Banded Grading:</b> In this type of assignment the
submissions are 	graded on a set of Yes/No scales. The grade is
determined by the "Grade 	Table " which gives the relationship between
the number of 	"errors" and the suggested grade. For example an
assignment may have six 	significant items which should be present, the
Grade Table will give suggested 	grades if all are present, one is
absent, if two are absent, etc.</li>
  <li><b>Criteria Grading:</b> This is simpliest type of assessment to
grade (although 	not necessarily the most straightforward to set up).
The submissions are 	graded against a set of criterion statments. The
assessor choses which statement 	best fits the piece of work. The grade
is determined by a "Criteria 	Table" which gives the suggested grade
for each criterion. </li>
</ol>
Next the teacher submits a small number (probably between 5 and 10)
example pieces of work. These most likely have been gleaned from
previous cohorts and should probably include both good and poor attempts
at the assignment.<br>
<br>
Lastly the teacher assesses these examples using the "grading form" set
up for the asssignment. The teacher's assessments are there to guide the
students when they start the assignment.<br>
<br>
With these three sets of items in place, the assessment elements (and
possibly the associated grade table), the example assignments and the
specimen assessments, the assignment can be opened up to the students.
The students' first task is usually to assess a selection of the
example assignments. As these assessments are produced the teacher
reviews them and, if satisfactory, the individual students are allowed
to progress to the next stage. The teacher may ask a student to
re-assess one or more of the example assessments. This should be easy to
do as once an example assignment is assessed the student is able to view
the teacher's "specimen" assessments. This loop is basically there to
check that the weaker students are aware of the specimen assessments and
have looked at them.<br>
<br>
At the end of this initial stage the students should have a fair idea
of what the assignment is about and how it is being assessed. They are
now allowed to submit their own work. This is not a fixed milestone,
each student will reach this second stage independently. With all the
inital assessments graded the teacher can sit back and let the module
run until the deadline date.<br>
<br>
The module can be set up to allow single submission or multiple
submissions. Depending on this setting, the student' first submission is
either their first draft or their only attempt.When the students have
submitted work they are asked to assess work from the other students.
They are also shown the assessments of their own work by the other
students. However, they must do at least one assessment before they are
shown the peer assessments. When the assignment allows resubmission the
student may, in the light of the feedback, revise their work and submit
a new copy for peer assessment. The peer assessment of student
submissions continues until the deadline date is reached.<br>
<br>
The teacher now has several choices. The module allows a flexible
approach to calculating the final grade for the students. In fact, the
final grade can be a teacher-defined combination of:<br>
<ol>
  <li>The teacher's grade of the (final) submission</li>
  <li>The average peer grade of the (final) submission</li>
  <li>The student's grading performance</li>
</ol>
Obviously if (1) is to be included then the teacher has to assess the
student submissions after the deadline. There is no real need for the
students' assessments produced during the peer asessment phase to be
graded by the teacher. The module can assess the quality of these
assignments by internal comparison. This is probably just as well as the
number of assessments generated at that phase could be quite large even
for reasonably sized classes. The final phase of the module is the
release of the final grades to the students.<br>
<br>
Thus the module normally runs through four phases:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Set up</li>
  <li>Student assessment of the example assignments, submission of work
and peer assessment</li>
  <li>Calculation of final grades</li>
  <li>Release of final grades</li>
</ol>
And there's a single deadline occurring between phases 2 and 3.<br>
<br>
<h3>Variants</h3>
That describes the "standard" assignment which this module supports.
The module also lends itself to a few other types of assignment. For
example, a "case study" assignment  can be handled where the teacher
sets up a number of scenarios for the students to comment on. Here there
are no student submissions the teacher simply grades the students
responses to each scenario and uses those to calculate the final grades.<br>
<br>
A second example using the module in an abbrieviated way is as a simple
peer assessment assignment. Here the teacher sets up the assessment
elements but does not submit any example assignments and the students go
straight in to the peer assessment phase, possibly going where no class
has boldly gone before!<br>
<br>
For certain assignments the teacher may decide that the example
assignments would simply lead the students into doing a cut-and-paste
exercise to produce their assignments. Here the initial assessment phase
would be better performed on a set of examples from a related subject
rather than those directly pertaining to the particular assignment. In
this way the students are shown what is expected of them and how it is
being assessed but "the cat is still in the bag" so to speak. Careful
monitoring of the assignment would be necessary else many students, not
reading the instructions, would reproduce the examples rather then the
required assignment.<br>
<br>
The module can also be set up to ask the students to asssess their own
work. That is instead of peer assessment the assignment becomes one
involving self assessment. Here it is likely that the teacher would
grade the (self) assessments make in the second half of phase 2 and
include these grades in the final grades.<br>
<br>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
Thus the module is quite flexible while still being relatively easy to
set up and run. The module has been keep purposely simple. For example
it does not allow the students to enter into an assessment - reply -
assessment cycle during the peer assessment phase. &nbsp;If that
sophistication is required then the Peer Graded Assignment module should
be used. Other technical restrictions are that the submitted assignments
are limited to a single file, that is although multiple submissions are
allowed each submission can only be just one file. The files themselves
are limited to a prediefined size and the module does not support links
to external pieces of work.<br>
