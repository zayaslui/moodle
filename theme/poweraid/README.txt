This theme has no hardcoded colors, everything is set in the files
style.php and config.php
Remember;
If you change the;
    $THEME->themeborders
It can hurt your eyes if you choose the wrong color ;-)

To change the logo to something that is more like you...
edit the files frontlogo.jpg and smalllogo.jpg that you can find inside the;
moodledir/theme/poweraid/images/

For other configuration options for this theme please see the config.php

Other than that, i should think that most of the options for this theme
is simple to understand.
