This directory contains authentication modules.

Each of these modules describes a different way to 
check that a user has provided a correct 

   - username, and 
   - password.

Even when external forms of authentication are being
used, Moodle still maintains the internal "user" table 
with all the associated information about that user such
as name, email address and so on.

The active method is set by the admin on the Configuration page.


email - authentication by email  (DEFAULT METHOD)

    - user fills out form with email address
    - email sent to user with link 
    - user clicks on link in email to confirm
    - user account is created
    - user can log in


none  - no authentication at all .. very insecure!!
    
    - user logs in using ANY username and password
    - if the username doesn't already exist then
      a new account is created
    - when user tries to access a course they 
      are forced to set up their account details
